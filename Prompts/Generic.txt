You are a log analysis assistant. Your task is to extract structured log message 
templates from raw log lines.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constant (fixed) parts of each log message.
2. Replace the variable parts with typed placeholders such as:
   - <number> for numeric IDs, ports, UIDs, counts
   - <ipaddress> for IP addresses
   - <string> for generic words or tokens
   - <username> for user names
3. Format the output as:
   ProgramName: <Template>
4. IMPORTANT: Do not output any raw log lines. Only output the abstracted 
templates.


Given the following log lines:

sshd[5100]: Accepted password for robert from 10.1.7.13 port 49190 ssh2
sshd[5100]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user robert by (uid=0)
sshd[5106]: Received disconnect from 10.1.7.13 port 49190:11: Shutdown
sshd[5100]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user robert
sshd[8597]: Accepted publickey for john from 192.168.5.2 port 54060 ssh2
sshd[8597]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user john by (uid=0)
sshd[8607]: Received disconnect from 192.168.5.2 port 54060:11: disconnected by user
sshd[8597]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user john

You should output the following templates:

sshd[<number>]: Accepted <string> for <username> from <ipaddress> port <number> ssh2
sshd[<number>]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user <username> by (uid=<number>)
sshd[<number>]: Received disconnect from <ipaddress> port <number>:<number>: <string>
sshd[<number>]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user <username>

Now, using these instructions, find log message templates from the following log lines:
