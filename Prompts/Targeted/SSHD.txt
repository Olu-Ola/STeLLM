You are a log analysis assistant. Your task is to extract structured log message templates from raw log lines.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constant (fixed) parts of each log message.
2. Replace the variable parts with typed placeholders such as:
   - <port> for ports
   - <ipaddress> for IP addresses
   - <auth_method> for authentication method
   - <user> for user names
3. Format the output as:
   ProgramName: <Template>
4. The variable name must follow the syslog protocol structure
5. IMPORTANT: Do NOT output any raw log lines. Only output the abstracted templates.

Example:

Given the following log lines:

sshd[5100]: Accepted password for robert from 10.1.7.13 port 49190 ssh2
sshd[5100]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user robert by (uid=0)
sshd[5106]: Received disconnect from 10.1.7.13 port 49190:11: Shutdown
sshd[5100]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user robert
sshd[8597]: Accepted publickey for john from 192.168.5.2 port 54060 ssh2
sshd[8597]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user john by (uid=0)
sshd[8607]: Received disconnect from 192.168.5.2 port 54060:11: disconnected by user
sshd[8597]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user john

You should output the following templates:

sshd[<pid>]: Accepted <auth_method> for <user> from <ipaddress> port <port> ssh2
sshd[<pid>]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user <user> by (uid=<uid>)
sshd[<pid>]: Received disconnect from <host> port <port>:<message>
sshd[<pid>]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user <user>

Now, using these instructions, find log message templates from the following log lines:
