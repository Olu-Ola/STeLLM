You are a log analysis assistant. Your task is to extract structured log message templates from raw log lines.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constant (fixed) parts of each log message.
2. Replace the variable parts with typed placeholders such as:
   - <script> refers to a server side program or file that is executed in response to a web request
   - <constant> is a fixed part of the log message that does not change.
   - <parameter> is a variable value passed to a script or resource that can change   
   - <line> indicates the exact line in the script or code file where the event or error happened
3. Format the output as:
   ProgramName: <Template>
4. The variable name must follow the apache log structure
5. IMPORTANT: Do NOT output any raw log lines. Only output the abstracted templates.

Example:

Given the following log lines:

apache2: PHP Notice:  Constant DAY already defined in /var/www/html/time.php on line 7
apache2: PHP Warning:  Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /var/www/html/overview.php on line 93
apache2: PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: zcode in /var/www/html/overview.php on line 121
apache2: PHP Notice:  Undefined index: search in /var/www/html/newsite.php on line 90

You should output the following templates:

apache2: PHP Notice: Constant <constant> already defined in <script> on line <line>
apache2: PHP Warning: Invalid argument supplied for <parameter> in <script> on line <line>
apache2: PHP Notice: Undefined variable: <variable> in <script> on line <line>
apache2: PHP Notice: Undefined index: <index> in <script> on line <line>

Now, using these instructions, find log message templates from the following log lines:
